### Business problem statement

Swire Coca-Cola has faced major challenges in managing production and inventory for its new products, Starlight and Dreamworld. Each product showed different patterns in sales, highlighting the need for better forecasting and planning. Starlight had solid sales for the first 30 weeks, but then sales dropped due to problems getting enough syrup for production. This issue prevented the company from making as much profit as it could have, even though there was strong media support and public interest that could have increased sales even more. On the other hand, Dreamworld started with high sales that quickly fell after just 14 weeks. This drop wasn't because of supply problems but because the company made too much product, expecting higher demand. This resulted in too much stock and financial losses.

These challenges have made it clear that Swire Coca-Cola must improve how it predicts demand and adjusts production quickly. As Swire plans to launch seven new products, applying these improvements is essential. By doing so, the company aims to manage inventory levels better and prevent running out of products or producing too much, thereby saving costs and satisfying customers. This strategic approach will be crucial in successfully introducing the new products and avoiding the pitfalls experienced with Starlight and Dreamworld.
